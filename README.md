In this portfolio, I wanted to describe my diverse skill set, showcase projects
I worked on, and highlight what I have been learning over the years.

I wanted the website content to reflect some of my skills so I

- spent some time on the UX (navigation, scroll behavior etc..)
- designed the screens in Figma
- incorporated a 3D scene that I designed in Spline
- took time to set up CI

# Design

After some thinking on what aspects of my work I wanted to showcase, I landed
while I was hiking on a stack of rocks representing the projects that I work on
and that together come to shape my style as a designer, coder, and product
owner.

I sketched a rough outline of the website, bounced ideas with my wife, and
iterated in Figma ([have a
look](https://www.figma.com/file/2k7R21lwIc82hlPHH9BqyY/Portfolio-Pierre?type=design&node-id=633%3A226&mode=design&t=dNvK758we7VqyNq2-1)).
I designed the 3D stack of pebbles using Spline modeling and sculpting tools
([have a look at the
scene](https://my.spline.design/untitled-dd331bee5e206ab1848bfa21db2ffc91/)),
before I ported it to Three.js use the Three.js editor.

I stuck with a mono font, and teal theme with very saturated highlights to have
a modern dev look.

# Run Locally

Run it locally with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed:

```bash
nvm install && nvm use && npm install
npm run dev
```

# Implementation Decisions

## File Structure

<details>
<summary>Pages and Layouts</summary>

I like Next.js 13 file-system based `app` router. You can set and remember
routes easily. But I don't like having a bunch of files all named `page.tsx` or
`layout.tsx`. They make file hopping slower during development. To address this,
I create my own Page and Layout components forwarded in `page.tsx` and
`layout.tsx` (e.g. `RootPage` and `RootLayout` are imported and immediately
re-exported by `app/page` and `app/layout`).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Reusable components</summary>

I place components and hook reused throughout the app in root `components` and
`hooks` directories. This organization by function can be messy but it's a small
price to pay to avoid big refactoring costs ([cf Josh
Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/file-structure/#organized-by-function-12)).
I will usually keep specific components in the same directory as the page they
are used in, and when I start reusing them I move them to the top-level
`components` directory.

</details>

## CI

<details>
<summary>Decisions</summary>

My CI pipeline is definitely overkill since I'm alone on this project, but it
was a good exercise to get familiar with Github Actions.

The pipeline lints, formats, tests, builds, and deploys previews URLs on every
PR or push to master. I run jobs concurrently when possible and cache
./node_modules and ~/.npm to speed up the pipeline.

I also automated the release process. I can trigger the workflow manually from
main, and it bumps the npm version, creates a Github Release with auto-generated
notes, and deploysÂ the portfolio to production.

I hooked the dev, staging, and prod deployments to Github Deployments for a nicer
overview and links in the github UI.

</details>

## Images

<details>
<summary>Decisions</summary>

I host images on a public Google Cloud bucket rather than keeping them locally.
This lets me recreate/deploy the project on another machine or in CI without
the hassle of Git LFS or custom download scripts. Next doesn't generate blurred
image placeholders for remote images so I use [blurred.dev](https://blurred.dev)
to generate the base64 image blur placeholders myself.

</details>

# Stack and Library Decisions

## Next.js

<details>
<summary>Rationale</summary>

### Why I chose it

- Hot skill to have these days
- Easy way to play around with React server components and Suspense
- Nice routing system and links prefetching
- Easy Image optimization (caching, levering WebP, logic hosted on functions on
  the edge)
- Easy google fonts integration and fallback font

### What I don't love

- Next uses SWC (which should be on par with esbuild) to compile typescript, but
  it still uses **webpack5** for bundling and HMR in development which makes it slow
  on server start and updates compared to Vite. Plugins in webpack5 are also
  supposed to be a pain to write compared to Rollup or Vite.
- Even though they let you use TurboPack in dev, it's still in beta, not
  widespread, and there are annoying issues like making svgr work
  ([details](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/48140))
- Next doesn't generate base64 image blur placeholders on remote images
- Not a lot of explanation in the docs around the relatively large bundle size
  even with a simple

</details>

## Vercel

<details>
<summary>Rationale</summary>

### Why I chose it

- Individual preview links are really nice
- Natural choice for Next.js to host server and work with React server
  components (with serverless functions on the edge)
- Nice that image optimization runs on the edge with nice caching

### What I don't love

- Docs don't say much about the WebP compression settings used in their image
  optimization (e.g. lossy vs lossless)

</details>

## Tailwind

<details>
<summary>Rationale</summary>

### Why I chose it

- Hot skill to have these days
- I like the principle of co-locating style as close to the tag/component as
  possible. Unlike CSS Modules or styled-components, I don't have to think about
  naming styles which removes a lot of difficulty, overhead, and
  miscommunication between developers.
- CSS rules are generated at build time rather than runtime (like Chakra UI)
- Simple design which makes it easy for people to build and distribute very
  customizable and extendable component libraries (like headless ui, tailwind
  components, or shadcn) on top of it, without having a bunch of custom syntax
  or rules.
- VSCode extensions with autocomplete, color preview, and tooltips is really
  nice

### What I don't love

- Lots of classnames can hurts readability imo and it can be hard to find the
  tailwind rule you're looking for in this large string. Bugs arising from order
  in the cascading stylesheet are also not intuitive. That said, it hasn't been
  much of an issue since I started using tailwind-merge and the `cn` util
  function to construct class names. It not only prevents bugs but it also
  allows to break strings apart and add comments between string segments.
- Semantic tokens and theming aren't really supported. The explanation by
  Tailwind's CEO that it would not be useful is wrong imo, and designers and
  large companies have now adopted semantic tokens for theming their design
  systems

</details>

## Shadcn

<details>
<summary>Rationale</summary>

### Why I chose it

- TODO: Fill

### What I don't love

-

</details>

## SVGR

<details>
<summary>Rationale</summary>

### Why I chose it

- Loading SVGs as React components is more flexible than `img` tags. I can style
  and animate the SVGs directly in CSS.

</details>

## GSAP

<details>
<summary>Rationale</summary>

### Why I chose it

- Quite a few forum posts and docs online
- ScrollTrigger pinning behavior is nice and there doesn't seem to be an easy
  alternative to gsap

### What I don't love

- API seems a bit messy to me (lots of strings), and TS hints aren't very
  helpful
- Documentation sometimes feel outdated (pinSpacing default behavior is
  confusing in the docs), or unclear
- No straightforward integration with React (e.g. no hooks)

</details>

## React Three Fiber

<details>
<summary>Rationale</summary>

### Why I chose it

- Nice to have a declarative API integrated with React to control Three.js
- Removes some boilerplate (e.g. scene and renderer setup)
- Lots of useful utilities with @react-three/drei which augment
  react-three-fiber
- leva is nicely designed UI to control react-three-fiber components

### What I don't love

- DREI and leva docs and support seem to be a bit hit or miss, and some
  questions around whether the repos they are and will remain actively
  maintained (for instance lamina, in fiber examples, has been archived, and
  leva has a lot of input todos not addressed)

</details>
