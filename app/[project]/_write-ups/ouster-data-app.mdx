# Ouster Data App

Full-stack upgrade of internal web tool

<ProjectWrapperBelowTitles project={props.project}>

As I was working on the lidar-based
[Fleetguide safety product](/fleetguide-360-view), the team had built an
_internal web tool to visualize data_ collected on the trucks.

{/* It was helpful to check the health of the system (like sensors alignment or */}
{/* dirty sensors) and capture interesting scenes for product development. */}

</div>
We soon realized that this Fleetguide tool could benefit other teams at Ouster. _I
championed the Data App throughout the organization_ and tailored it to its multi-faceted
needs. I went on to make the _majority of the full-stack upgrades_ including data
modeling, database migration, API updates, containerized jobs, and new visualization
features.

When I left Ouster, the Data App had become a _key part of the company's
workflows. More than 2000 recording had been uploaded._

## Championing cloud workflows

At the start of the project, I _talked to a dozen Ouster employees_ to
understand how they used recorded lidar data and see if storing and playing it
in the cloud could benefit them. The opportunities were vast:

- _Marketing and sales_ could share sample data with customers in blog posts and
  emails to highlight data quality and use cases
- _Product_ could collaborate with customers on beta features and communicate
  about the data right inside to data
- _Customer success_ could have customers upload issues to better diagnose and
  help them troubleshoot
- _Firmware_ could collaborate among themselves and share progress to the rest
  of Ouster while working on upgrades. They could store integration tests
  recordings to assess point cloud quality continuously
- _Test engineering_ could use it as a repository for their test data
- _Field application engineering_ could review data from installations they
  managed, and store interesting snippets from field trips
- _Quality Assurance_ could share with manufacturing and firmware the detected
  issues uncovered during failure analysis on long-term tests

We had no PM or manager at the time (other than the CEO) so _I was in charge of
the roadmap_. I proposed to first focus on processes <i>without</i> customers to
validate the tool's usability and value internally, and then to gradually
increase complexity in data access.

{/* We would then gradually increase access to the outside customer, first by making */}
{/* public data available to anyone online, then letting customers log in and upload */}
{/* private data to Ouster, and finally give customers their own workspace of the */}
{/* Data App, if the opportunity arose. */}

## Backend updates

For the first iteration of the homepage design, I opted for a simple table
listing every uploaded recording. _A single table for all of Ouster would
encourage browsing, increase data reuse, and advertise the tool usage._

To avoid the list being overwhelming, I worked with users to define a set of
flexible column filters. On top of expected attributes (dates, lidar info,
firmware version), we introduced a _data category_ (like <i>internal
test</i>,<i> sample data</i>, or <i>customer request</i>) to get why the data
was recorded, and _tags_ (like <i>retro-reflectors</i>, <i>bicycle</i>, {/*  */}
or <i>mining</i>) to know what's in it.

For tags to surface interesting data collections, I wanted to discourage
duplicates {/* super duper long line break to prevent prettier from adding */}
(like <i>car</i>, <i>Car</i>, <i>vehicle</i>, <i>auto</i>, <i>aauto</i>) so I
designed tag selectors as a dropdown instead of freeform text. I worked with
Ouster users to create an initial taxonomy that they could extend in the UI.

To reflect this updated domain knowledge, I developed a new data model. I
updated the Python _Flask REST API_ with _SQLAlchemy_, and added test fixtures
for new endpoints. I handled migrations of the _Postgres_ db with _Alembic_,
making sure freeform tags from existing Fleetguide data would make it {/*  */}
to the new <i>tag</i> database table. I deployed the staging and production
systems using _Terraform_ - the Postgres db was hosted on GCP, and the Flask app
was uploaded to _GCP Cloud Run_ as a _Docker_ container.

I then updated the frontend home based on wireframes I had designed in Figma,
and took the opportunity refactor the codebase to use React hooks.

## Easy data uploads

I designed an _upload dialog_ for Ouster employees to upload their lidar
recordings (1 data and 1 config file) right from the Data App homepage.

The more data people uploaded, the more useful the Data App would be! Reducing
friction here was key to the success and adoption of the tool so I spent some
time thinking about the UX of uploading data:

- Point cloud data can get very large (1GB/min as a rule of thumb) and uploads
  are long. Progress feedback was important to avoid frustration.
- The config file associated with every recording was often a source of
  confusion. Users sometimes forgot it or erroneously reused files. Displaying
  parsed information, warnings, and errors could help them check this was
  correct file.
- The more users categorize their data on upload, the more datasets would emerge
  for everyone else to use. I strove to make tag selection as easy, fast, and
  enticing as possible.

  I also contributed to the creation of a new upload data pipeline. I extracted
  config file information to display them to the user and to ingest them the
  database. This took the form of Python library code running on _Docker_
  containers deployed on _Google Compute Engine_ instances and orchestrate with
  serverless _Cloud Run_ compute platform.

## Visualization upgrades

While I did not have a chance to revisit the look of the 3D scene controls (for
more on this, read my [Ouster Studio](/ouster-studio) page), I did implement
_additions and improvements to the internal Three.js visualization library_
powering the Data App. Some changes showcased new firmware features, and
collaborating with the firmware team was important to design the best
visualization strategy.

<ProjectVideo

  caption="Visualizing 2023 sample data in the Data App (using shortcuts). Play me in full screen!"
/>

- It was important to let users _download the data_ for the freedom to view or
  analyze it elsewhere. I designed a simple popover with icons reminding whether
  the file has already been downloaded.

<ProjectImage name="oust_da_7_download" />

- I added _range rings_ to get a sense for distances in the scene and for the
  lidar maximum detection range. I made sure ring labels did not overlap with
  each other and stayed readable in all camera perspectives.

<ProjectImage name="oust_da_8_range_rings" />

- Perspective projection is a natural way to view a 3D scene but orthographic
  projection is better to estimate distances and objects'shapes. I made sure
  users could _toggle between camera projections_ without resetting the camera
  position and orientation.

<ProjectImage name="oust_da_9_camera_type" />

- Ouster lidar started outputting 8-bit _reflectivity_ data in firmware 2.1.
  Points now kept the same 'color' in the scene no matter how far they were from
  the lidar. This could improve customers' classification and mapping
  algorithms. I modified the rendering pipeline to accurately display the
  reflectivity data, which was not linearly mapped to the real reflectivity
  values (due to retro-reflectors).

<ProjectImage name="oust_da_10_calibrated_reflectivity" quality={100} />

- For Near IR ambient light data, noise inherent to the sensor receiver silicon
  chip (called
  [dark count rate](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_avalanche_diode#Dark_count_rate_(DCR)>))
  produces artificial stripes in the rows. The SDK team had written a C++
  algorithm to _suppress this noise_. I rewrote it for Javascript and made
  improvements to it.

<ProjectImage name="oust_da_11_noise_suppression" />

- From firmware 2.2 Ouster lidars started outputting values for the _second
  strongest return_. A second point might now be displayed for each pixel of the
  lidar image.

<ProjectImage name="oust_da_12_returns" />

- To _avoid distortions in the lidar '2D' image representation_, I constrained
  them to the sensor 'real' aspect ratio. A 360Â° lidar with a taller field of
  view would now naturally mean a taller 2D image.

<ProjectImage name="oust_da_13_2D_image_aspect_ratio" />

- For power users, I added _keyboard shortcuts_ adapting to pc and mac. In the
  code I enforced that a shortcut key press would always trigger a toast for
  user feedback.

<ProjectImage name="oust_da_14_shortcuts" />

## Sharing data with customers

Once adoption became widespread within Ouster, it was time to broaden the
audience. The next step was to _disseminate sample data to customers_ through
the Data App. Prospective customers would no longer need to download and install
a software to play with point clouds. They could just click a link from a
marketing email and start exploring.

To avoid leaking Ouster private information like some of the tags or notes, I
designed a public link generation workflow inspired by tools like Airtable.
Anyone at Ouster could now generate a public link accessible to anyone online
without the need for a login. However only public endpoints are fetched there,
and private information remains protected.

## CES VR Demo

As a bonus, let me share an after-hour side project: _a VR branch of the Data
App_. By leveraging the WebXR Device API and Three.js WebXRManager, I was able
to turn public Data App links inside into a VR experience. Marketing got word of
it and the demo ended up used at Ouster's 2023 CES booth. Here is a
low-resolution screen capture I made with my Oculus Go.
