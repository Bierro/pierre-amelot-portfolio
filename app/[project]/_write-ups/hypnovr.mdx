# Hypno VR App Doctor's View

Medical hypnosis in VR: Helping anesthesiologist manage VR sessions.

<ProjectWrapperBelowTitles project={props.project}>

Anesthesiologists who practice medical hypnosis can lower the amount of
medication needed during procedures. Although the practice accelerates patient
recovery and reduces side effects, its adoption remains limited. It is fairly
time-consuming and tiring: the anesthesiologist has to focus and talk constantly
to their patient during the procedure.

In 2018, the founding team of the French startup
[HypnoVR](https://www.hypnovr.io/en/) reached out to me to design and build an
MVP for their portal app for Oculus Rift. Working on evenings and weekends, _I
built a Unity app to allow anesthesiologists to launch, monitor and manage VR
hypnosis sessions_. From their computer screen, they can now fully control the
VR scenarios (developed by outside gaming studios) shown to the patient, and get
real-time feedback on what they were seeing.
