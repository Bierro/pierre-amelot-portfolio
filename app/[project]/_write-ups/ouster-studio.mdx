# Ouster Studio

Unifying Ouster Lidar ecosystem of visualizers

<ProjectWrapperBelowTitles project={props.project}>

[Ouster lidars](https://ouster.com) set themselves apart through their
multi-layer high-resolution data, well suited to classify objects and build
maps. First-time customers try to see it for themselves before purchasing a
lidar. They evaluate the data quality with Ouster Studio, a GUI visualizer.

Ouster Studio's development had been outsourced. Its UI was clunky and failed to
highlight Ouster's strengths, leading to missed sales opportunities. _In 2022, I
re-designed and implemented Ouster Studio's UI._
{/* , and to a high number of long-term lidar loans (expensive for the company). */}

Bringing Ouster Studio's development in-house unlocked a new vision for all the
visualizers used by customers and internal teams. _I created a unified set of
looks and interactions, and designed a seamless integration between tools._ This
took the form of a light Figma design system and a React component library for
web and Electron apps.

## Uncovering insights

At the project inception I turned to PMs, field application engineers, product
marketers, and customer success. They had extensive knowledge of customer
workflows and pain points during and after sales. Their observations were
unanimous: Ouster Studio was clunky, expensive to maintain, and communication
with the third-party developers was not smooth, often leading to bugs or delays
in the visualizer releases.

<ProjectImage
  name="oust_studio_5_interviews"
  caption="Internal interviews with PMs, field engineers, and product marketers"
/>

From these interviews, I mapped out user journeys and described the core
features customers needed when evaluating lidars with a GUI.

<ProjectImage
  name="oust_studio_8_features_for_eval"
  caption="Visualizer features needed to evaluate a lidar"
/>

I also conducted a
[usability heuristic](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
evaluation to identify pitfalls that a redesign should avoid. <i>Visibility of
system status</i>, <i>Recognition rather than recall</i>, or <i>Aesthetic and
minimalistic design</i> were some principles that had been neglected in the old
UI.

## Unification opportunity

{/* Visualization is a critical step of customers' but also of Ouster's internal teams' processes. */}

At Ouster, multiple visualizers had grown organically across engineering teams
over time, scattering the user experience and duplicating efforts. After
observing some internal teams workflows, it appeared their point cloud analysis
and data recording needs could be met by a new Ouster Studio. It had potential
to become a one-stop shop inside the company.

{/* To visualize live sensors, test engineers built custom Python tools, firmware */}
{/* engineers used Ouster SDK's OpenGL visualizer, customers used Ouster Studio for */}
{/* certain workflows and Ouster SDK for others, robotics engineers used RViz, and */}
{/* solution teams were building their own UIs with domain-specific features. */}

{/* I talked to various teams to understand what might make Ouster Studio their */}
{/* one-stop shop. Some teams reported to me that they could make the new Ouster */}
{/* Studio their one-stop shop */}

{/* Precise inspection of 2D images, data analytics for each point in the point */}
{/* cloud, or slicing recordings by file size were some of the needs that emerged. */}

The web-based [Data App](/ouster-data-app) (for data storage and sharing) and
domain-specific solutions had to remain separate from Ouster Studio though, but
they could still benefit from a unified UX. Selecting points, measuring,
analyzing data, navigating the scene could all look, and feel the same across
UIs. _The opportunity for reusable components and reusable 3D interactions
emerged._

<ProjectImage
  name="oust_studio_10_libs_and_apps"
  caption="Vision for the parts enabling a seamless experience across Ouster visualizers"
/>

Bringing Ouster Studio in-house also _unlocked a tighter integration between
tools_. Ouster Studio could facilitate uploading data to the Data App right
after recording. The Data App could expose lists of sample data for Ouster
Studio to view and download.

{/* The need for reusable a component library and a 3D visualization library also */}
{/* emerged. This would allow the solutions team to build domain-specific UIs while */}
{/* keeping the look and the interactions consistent with Ouster Studio. The */}
{/* [Data App](/ouster-data-app) (web app used for retrieval and sharing of lidar */}
{/* data), would also benefit from the improvements brought by libraries. */}

{/* Through the [Data App project](/ouster-data-app), internal workflows involving */}
{/* storage, replay, and sharing of lidar data had mostly been moved to the cloud. */}
{/* Many Storing and sharing data online would have to work separately from the */}
{/* data-intensive live visualization a a sensor connected to the network (before */}
{/* websocket or webRTC), here lied an opportunity to unify the two UIs. */}

{/* Finally, mapping and */}

{/* Out of this research came a couple of findings: */}

{/* - The visualization page for Ouster Studio and the Data App could be almost the */}
{/* same, with tools like measurement, point selection, CSV export, being useful */}
{/* for both UIs */}

{/* Combine as many of these workflows into one, and define guidelines to create a */}
{/* unique look-and-feel for */}

## Inspirations

There already are many visualizers out in the world, some for generic 3D data,
some for 3D point clouds, some for lidars specifically. I took the time to
_catalogue some of them for visual and interaction inspirations._

<ProjectImage
  name="oust_studio_11_inspirations"
  caption="A catalogue of 3D visualizers screenshots I kept in Notion for inspiration"
/>

Spline design impressed me with its clean sidebars. Blender v3 camera controls
were simple yet intuitive, and the footer reminded users of mouse navigation
events. Navvis brought a clever magnifying glass to precisely select points.
Figma tab system for its Electron app showed an efficient use of space in a
clear design.

<ProjectImage

  caption="Interesting interactions and layout I used as inspiration for the redesign"

## Low-fidelity wireframes

After the research phase, I started _sketching out ideas_ building on the
research insights I gathered, on my knowledge maintaining the Data App, and on
inspirations.

<ProjectImage
  name="oust_studio_13_initial_sketches"
  caption="Notebook sketches I used to brainstorm ideas and layouts"
/>

I moved to rough low-fidelity wireframes using a
[Figma template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/887892609124245416) and
turned it into a clickable prototype.

<ProjectVideo
  name="oust_studio_14_low_fidelity_prototype"
  caption="Figma prototype of the low-fidelity wireframes I showed in design critique sessions"
/>

On these screens, _I ran design critique sessions_ with engineers, PMs, FAEs,
customer support, and management. I made sure to include international
team-members in Asia and Europe. The rich conversations revealed confusing
elements or wordings. Some suggestions led to new ideas: a tab system to play
multiple data sources simultaneously, lidar nicknames to differentiate them in a
multi-sensor system, or a button to share diagnostics with support when alerts
are triggered.

I wish I could have run user tests with customers, but due to product and time
restrictions I had to make do with internal users and stakeholders this time.
Check out my [Fleetguide 360Â°](/fleetguide-360-view) project if you're curious
about my process interacting with users.

## Design system

To plan for a UI library with reusable components, I created a small design
system. Building on industry best practices (from
[Asana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylDed18OVdY) or
[Figma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0BsybgcaI8)), I defined design tokens
working across light and dark theme to suit various visualizers.

  caption="Primary design tokens I derived from ouster brand colors"
/>

<ProjectImage
  name="oust_studio_16_semantic_design_tokens"
  caption="Color semantic design tokens"
/>

As I was creating screens, I also generated components with their variants in
the design system and I refined the tokens.

/>

<ProjectImage
  name="oust_studio_18_components_light_and_dark"
  caption="Semantic tokens made switching between light and dark theme instant"
/>

## High-fidelity prototype

As a final step before the code, I built high-fidelity screens for Ouster Studio
v2, as well as Data App v2 (whose visualizer page was almost the exact same UI
as Ouster Studio). I regularly shared screenshots and Figma prototype links on
the company Slack to advertise progress, solicit feedback, and prepare the
company for the upcoming changes.

Let me call out some UX interactions which I believe where novel and interesting
for a lidar visualizer.

## React component library

It was finally time to code! _I built from scratch the component library_ that
would power Ouster Studio, Data App, and other Ouster solutions.

<ProjectParagraphWithImages imageNames={["logo_vite"]} imageWidth="2.5rem">
  For dev and build tooling, I chose [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). I love its
  smart performant decisions (like serving file over native ESM in development
  or leaving type checking to the IDE), opinionated support of Typescript and
  CSS modules, clear and exhaustive docs, config flexibility and simple plugin
  system, and its leverage of the Rollup ecosystem for builds.

{/* I wrote a simple plugin to import bundled CSS into the library entrypoint (as a */}
{/* convenience for app builders) and it felt like a breeze. */}

</ProjectParagraphWithImages>

<ProjectParagraphWithImages imageNames={['logo_chakra_ui']} imageWidth="2.5rem">
  To build accessible UI elements without reinventing the wheel, I decided to
  use [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). I chose it for its first-class
  support of semantic tokens and for its style props (CSS co-located with the
  component without dealing with long strings). If I were to do it again, I
  would probably steer clear of runtime style injection and go with
  Tailwind/Radix (like this portfolio) or PandaCSS/Zag, but the team had been
  using styled-components so this was somewhat familiar to us.
</ProjectParagraphWithImages>

<ProjectParagraphWithImages
  imageNames={['logo_storybook']}
  imageWidth="2rem"
  imageClassName="mx-[0.25rem]"

  I used [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to document the components and
  showcase their behavior. I found it to be a nice way to broadcast the library
  to teammates, other engineering teams, and product managers.
</ProjectParagraphWithImages>

<ProjectImage
  name="oust_studio_23_storybook_design_system"
  caption="Storybook docs and stories for some of the design system components"
/>

In addition to classic design system elements, I incorporated components that
integrated with our internal 3D visualization library, like a playbar, panels
and headers.

<ProjectImage
  name="oust_studio_24_storybook_webviz"
  caption="Stories for components used in tandem with Ouster 3D viz library"
/>

I broke each component down into stories to test that they rendered without
errors, and leveraged
[Storybook play function](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/interaction-testing)
to add long overdue interaction tests.

<ProjectImage
  name="oust_studio_25_interaction_test"
  caption="Playbar interaction tests"
/>

I created a Storybook addon to switch between light and dark theme using Chakra
UI semantic token support.

<ProjectParagraphWithImages
  imageNames={['logo_gitlab']}
  imageWidth="2.5rem"
  imageClassName="mr-[0.25rem]"
>
  I built the library CI/CD pipeline with Gitlab CI. The pipeline formats,
  lints, builds, tests, and deploys the library. It runs Jest and Storybook
  tests (on three browsers - chromium, firefox, and webkit), and deploys
  Storybook to an internal URL. If the package version is bumped, it publishes a
  prerelease to Ouster internal package registry for open PRs. On merge to
  master, it publishes the release version.

## Ouster Studio v2.0.0 release

To quickly get the redesigned UI in the hands of users, the scope of the initial
version 2 release was limited to basic features like connecting to a sensor,
visualizing, recording, replaying, and exporting data.

_I left my job at Ouster before the 2.0.0 release, but still wrote almost all of
the front-end code for it._ I also lent a hand on the Rxjs data render pipeline,
on the Electron BrowserWindow initialization, and on the communication between
the main process (which talks to the sensor through the C++ Ouster SDK compiled
to WASM), and the renderer process. Try out the latest Ouster Studio release by
downloading it [here](https://ouster.com/downloads).

The new 2D image panel lets users inspect the data in a new light. They can dive
deeper into the image to understand and diagnose situations when the lidar might
not produce a range value for a given pixel (like black cars or windshields!).
