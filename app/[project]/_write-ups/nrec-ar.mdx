# Demining in AR

Training in Augmented Reality: Helping deminers use metal detectors.

<ProjectWrapperBelowTitles project={props.project}>

Scanning mined areas with a metal detector requires a rigorous technique. At all
times, the detector should be kept low and flat, and the moves should be precise
and slow. To build enough muscle memory, soldiers receive more than a hundred of
hours of training before going to the field.

As a Graphics Engineer at NREC (robotics R&D Lab attached to Carnegie Mellon
University), _I developed a Unity AR app to help deminers get instant feedback
on their technique_. I rapidly iterated over prototypes across a variety of
hardware and libraries, culminating in a HoloLens app overlaying the detector's
motion information directly on the ground.

## Project scope

When I joined NREC in 2017, the team had already built a
[custom piece of hardware](https://www.nrec.ri.cmu.edu/nrec/solutions/defense/other-projects/sweep-monitoring.html)
to track the detector's base relative to the ground. Position and orientation
measurements were sent by the device over the network.

The goal for this new project was to listen for these motion measurements, and
overlay them on the field of view of deminers using Augmented or Mixed Reality.
_My job as only engineer/designer on this AR project was to investigate
feasibility of this idea, and to build an experience that we could pitch to the
US Army Research Office._

## Initial experiments

I first experimented with different headsets the team had purchased: Atheer Air,
ODG R7, and Microsoft HoloLens. While field of view of the Atheer and form
factor of the ODG were appealing, their lack of inside-out tracking and the
hardware issues encountered gradually led me to prioritize for a HoloLens
experience.

As a software stack, I converged towards using Unity with the marker tracking
library Vuforia. This allowed to develop for different platforms at the same
time: while I was building HoloLens and ODG app for deminers, I was also getting
"for free" an Android mobile/tablet AR app that observers could use during
demos.

## Parallel prototyping

For faster prototype development, I recorded and replayed packets using a
combination of software: Wireshark, Colasoft Packet Player, and TraceWrangler. I
could then iterate offline over different visualizations of the detectors
movements.

## User tests

_Since I had no direct access to soldiers, I gathered feedback amongst NREC
employees, all first-time detector users, through user tests of the ODG and
HoloLens prototypes_.

Overall, my colleagues found the AR app gave them a clear framework to
self-improve on their technique. They also pointed out issues such as loss of
tracking (especially for tall users) and low framerate, and felt items like
tracking status, color palettes, and voice commands discoverability could be
improved.

## Performance improvements

Acting on users feedback, I took advantage of Unity's profiling tools to reduce
performance bottlenecks. In particular, I started writing detector position
measurements directly to a texture instead of rendering waypoints as individual
meshes.

To improve tracking, I also ran test bench experiments against multiple Vuforia
marker types and form factors. After recording data with Unity, exporting it to
CSV, and plotting the results in Matlab, I was able to print an optimized marker
for our use case.

## Pitch Video

Once stable, the HoloLens AR deminer app demo became a must-see stop of NREC
tours, and I also created a pitch video of the project to show visitors.

Although project sponsors were excited about the demo and prospects of the AR
app, I unfortunately never got direct access to soldiers in the 10 months I
worked at NREC, and many hypotheses were yet to be tested in actual military
training environment.
